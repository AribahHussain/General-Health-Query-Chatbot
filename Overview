# 🩺 General Health Query Chatbot

This project builds a conversational chatbot that answers general health-related questions using natural language processing, while strictly avoiding sensitive or clinical advice.

## ✅ Objective

To develop a chatbot capable of handling general health questions with a focus on user safety. It simulates friendly, non-medical conversations and avoids risky or inappropriate responses.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Programming language
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For loading conversational models
- **DialoGPT-medium (Microsoft)**: Pre-trained model for dialogue generation
- *(Optional)* **OpenAI API**: Mentioned but not used

## 🧠 Methodology

- **Library Setup**: Imported NLP and ML libraries
- **Model Loading**: Loaded `DialoGPT-medium` from Hugging Face
- **Sensitive Topic Filtering**: Detects and blocks risky topics like “cancer” or “self-harm”
- **Conversation Loop**: Runs until the user types “quit”
- **Response Generation**: Produces friendly, context-aware replies to general health questions

## 🔐 Safety Measures

- Avoids giving any clinical or emergency medical advice
- Blocks queries involving drug use, prescriptions, or diagnoses
- Acts as a **non-medical companion chatbot**

## 📊 Results

- Handles health-related FAQs (e.g., diet, hydration, exercise)
- Responds naturally and safely
- Prevents responses to unsafe or sensitive topics

## 📌 Conclusion

This chatbot demonstrates the responsible use of NLP for general wellness interaction. It is ideal for educational platforms, research prototypes, or as a support feature in non-clinical health apps.

## 📂 Dataset Information

This chatbot does not rely on an external structured dataset. Instead, it uses **pre-trained conversational language models** from Hugging Face (DialoGPT), which were originally trained on Reddit conversation datasets. No sensitive health data was used or stored.
