This chatbot was built using powerful Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools 🧠. The core programming was done in Python 🐍, with the Hugging Face Transformers library used to load conversational models 🤖. By default, the chatbot uses DialoGPT-medium by Microsoft, a pre-trained model designed for engaging dialogue. However, for more advanced or scalable deployments, you can optionally integrate OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 via API 🔑—offering richer responses and deeper context understanding. Alternatively, for those who prefer open-source solutions, the chatbot also supports Mistral-7B-Instruct 💡, a free and efficient large language model available on Hugging Face, making this project flexible for both free and enterprise-level use 🌍.
